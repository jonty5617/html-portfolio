<ul><li><hr><h3>Taare Zaamin Par</h3></li>
<p>It showcases how a student suffering with 
dyslexia is devoid of proper attention both 
from school and family until ateacher shows 
up at school who help this kid showcase his 
other talents.</p>
<li><h3>Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara</h3></li>
<p>This movies taught me, "we live once,
     which is why we should make sure to do it right!"</P>
<li><h3>Kabir Singh</h3></li>
<p>Though not a reccomendable movie but 
 I love it beacuse of its songs, 
    great romance & drug abuse 
    which was loved by me during my "Cool Teen" phase.</P></ul>
